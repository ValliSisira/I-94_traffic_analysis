    ## Insights from Traffic Volume Distribution

- The traffic volume ranges from 0 to around 7000 vehicles per hour.
- There are two prominent peaks in the distribution:
- One around 0â€“1000, which could represent low traffic hours, possibly during the night.
- Another major peak between 4000â€“5000, indicating high traffic hours, likely during rush hour.
- The distribution appears to be bimodal, suggesting two distinct traffic patterns during the day (low and high volume periods).
- Very high traffic volumes (above 6000) are less frequent, and the frequency gradually decreases in that range.

    ## Histogram Observations

## 1. Daytime Traffic (Left Plot):

- Shows a clear peak between 4000 and 5500 vehicles/hour, indicating high and consistent traffic during the day.
- Most values are concentrated between 3000 and 6000, typical for working hours or school runs.
- Very few low traffic volume instances during the day.

## 2. Nighttime Traffic (Right Plot):

- Displays a sharp peak below 1000 vehicles/hour, meaning most nighttime hours experience low traffic.
- The distribution is right-skewed, with occasional high-traffic outliers.
- Significantly more hours with very low volume (0â€“1000 range) compared to daytime.

    This line plot shows how the average daytime traffic volume on I-94 varies by month throughout the year.

## Key Observations:

- Lowest traffic volume is in December (Month 12), possibly due to holidays (Christmas/New Year),Winter weather conditions affecting road usage.
- Traffic volume increases steadily from January to May, peaking slightly around Mayâ€“June (Months 5â€“6).
- Sharp drop in July (Month 7) â€” we don't know the exact reason so let's see how the traffic volume changed each year in July
- August to October (Months 8â€“10) see another rise in traffic, possibly as schools and work routines resume.
- A noticeable decline starts in November and drops sharply in December.

This line chart shows how average daytime traffic volume varies across the days of the week, where:

## Key Observations:

- Weekday traffic (Monday to Friday) is consistently high:
- Peaks around Wednesday and Thursday, with average traffic volume exceeding 5250 vehicles/hour.
- Slight dip on Monday, likely due to slower starts or flexible work schedules.
- Sharp decline starting Saturday (5):
Traffic drops to around 3900 vehicles/hour on Saturday.
- Lowest traffic is seen on Sunday, at roughly 3400 vehicles/hour.
- The weekend traffic is significantly lower, aligning with reduced work-related travel and more flexible schedules.

    ## Traffic Volume by Hour: Weekdays vs Weekends
This analysis shows how average traffic volume changes by hour of the day, comparing business days with weekends.

 Weekdays (Mondayâ€“Friday):

- Sharp peak at 7 AM: Highest volume (~6030 cars/hour) occurs during the morning rush hour, as people commute to work.
- A second, broader peak in the late afternoon (4â€“5 PM) indicates the evening rush.
- Between 11 AM and 2 PM, traffic volume dips slightly but remains steady.
- This trend shows a typical two-peak (bimodal) pattern seen in daily work commutes.

 Weekends (Saturdayâ€“Sunday):

- Traffic volume is lower overall compared to weekdays.
- There is no sharp morning peak. Instead, traffic volume gradually rises starting around 8 AM and stays relatively steady between 10 AM and 4 PM (~4300â€“4400 cars/hour).
- This flatter curve suggests more flexible travel times, likely due to leisure activities, errands, or outings.

    ## Key Observations:

- Highest average traffic volumes occur during:
    Thunderstorms, Drizzle, Rain, and Clear weather.
- Surprisingly, bad weather conditions like Thunderstorm and Rain show traffic volumes comparable to or higher than clear conditions.
- Lowest average traffic volume is observed during Fog, possibly due to reduced visibility discouraging travel.
- Other weather types like Mist, Haze, Snow, and Smoke show fairly consistent traffic levels, with only slight variation.
- Squall and Snow also show slightly lower volumes compared to clear days but not significantly.

## Interpretation:

- Weather conditions do not drastically reduce traffic volume in most cases.
- High traffic during rainy or stormy conditions might indicate that people still commute regardless of weather, or possibly, that these conditions occur during peak hours.
- The drop in volume during foggy conditions suggests that severe visibility issues may influence traffic behavior more than general rain or snow.
- Since variations are minor, it confirms previous findings that weather has a weak correlation with traffic volume.

This scatter plot visualizes the relationship between traffic volume and temperature (in Kelvin) using daytime data.

Key Observations:

- The points are densely clustered between:
    - Traffic volume: 3000â€“6000 vehicles/hour
    - Temperature: 270â€“300 K (roughly 0Â°C to 27Â°C)
- There is no strong visible trend or pattern between temperature and traffic volume:
    - Data points are spread across all temperature levels, even at high traffic volumes.
    - The distribution is somewhat horizontal, suggesting low or weak correlation.
- Extreme temperatures (below 250 K or above 310 K) show fewer observations, possibly because such conditions are rare in the region or time period analyzed.
- This confirms the low correlation coefficient (~0.13) observed earlier between temperature and traffic volume.
- While traffic tends to be slightly higher in moderate to warm temperatures, temperature alone does not significantly affect traffic volume.
- Other factors like weather, hour of the day, day of the week, and work schedules likely play a much more important role.
